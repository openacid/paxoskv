// A Proposer sends all its fields in a Prepare request, with `Val` being left a nil.
// A Proposer sends all its fields in an Accept request, with `Val` being filled with
// the value it chose.

// An Acceptor responds all its fields in a Prepare reply.

// Thus we just use the struct of a Proposer as request struct.
